# Fake 3D Renderer

Primitive & Naive 3D engine.  

## Support 

 * Provides OpenGl Abstraction 
 * Primitive camera actions: moving and zooming
 * Phong lighting 
 
## Getting Started

The project was divided into two parts:
 1. General requirements
    * Any library - OpenGL/glfw3/glew32/stb
    * Any programming language - C++
    * Result: statically linked 32/64 bit Windows application
    * Cases listed below shall be written from scratch 
 2. Camera support
    * Moving up-down left-right forward-backward
    * Zoom In & Zoom Out
    * Rotate via axises X, Y, Z
    * I/O - Keyboard 
 3. Lighting Support
    * Light Reflection Algorithm - Phong
    * Analyse Reflection
        * Smooth surface
        * Rough surface
        * Intensity
 4. Official Report - attachment is not project at the moment
    * Manual - how to run, keys
    * Project description
    * Algorithms analysis
        * Prediction vs Reality 
            * Algorithms 
            * Pool Ball
        * Effect of set ups border values   
 4. Additional
    * Movable sun - analysis reflection behaviour
    * Resizable window
